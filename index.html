  About me
</h1>
<p>I did not like school, but I love learning. My first job involved writing theorem provers in Pascal and I have been building websites since 1995 for, among others, The Guardian, the BBC and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games. I am now a part of Founders &amp; Coders, a community of freelance developers and educators.</p>
